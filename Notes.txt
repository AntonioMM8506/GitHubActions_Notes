GitHub Actions

Introduction & Basic Concepts +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A tool that lets you automate your software development workflows.

It allows you to react to some events that can happen in your repository or outside of your repository. And run a workflow in response to that event.

Workflows => They are configurable automate processed that you can set up in your repository in order to perform a certain task.
    - Tetsing your code.
    - Pybishing a package
    - Deploying an application
    - Sending a message to another platform such as Slack
    - Opening an Issue in GitHub

A workflow can have multiple steps. 
    - Events 
        - Repository Events: Push, Pull Request, Issue.
        - External Events: Sending a POST request to a REST API.
        - Scheduled Times
        - Manually
    - Worflow 
        - Job: Each Job run independent from each other, they usually run in their individual runner machine in parallel. 
            - Runner Machine
                - GitHub Hosted Runners (Windows/Linux/MacOS tools installed)
                - Self Hosted Runners (More responsibility/More customization)
                - Larger Runners (Hosted by GitHub with more RAM & CPU)
            - Steps
                - Action

In the root path, create a folder .github
Inside this one create another folder and name it workflows
there you can store all the yaml files


+++++ COMMANDS +++++
In the GitHub CLI one can run the following commands in order to enable or disable a Workflow
gh workflow w enale "First Workflow"
gh workflow w disable "Firt Workflow"

A Workflow running cannot be canceled


One can add Secrets and Variables in GitHub
Settings => Secrets and Variables => Actions
A SECRET has priority over a VARIABLE

For DEBUGGING add the following variables
    ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG = true
    ACTIONS_STEP = true


++++ COMMANDS ++++
In order to SKIP a Workflow 
In the commit Message include [no ci] / [skip ci] / [ci skip] / [skip actions] / [actions skip]
git commit -am "Don't Run [skip ci]"

By default, the repository is not cloned into the Workflow Runner Machine.
For this you need to checkout the files to the runner machine. See checkout.yaml.

${{ secret.MYSECRET }} => way to call a secret into a command inside a yaml file
