GitHub Actions

A tool that lets you automate your software development workflows.

It allows you to react to some events that can happen in your repository or outside of your repository. And run a workflow in response to that event.

Workflows => They are configurable automate processed that you can set up in your repository in order to perform a certain task.
    - Tetsing your code.
    - Pybishing a package
    - Deploying an application
    - Sending a message to another platform such as Slack
    - Opening an Issue in GitHub

A workflow can have multiple steps. 
    - Events 
        - Repository Events: Push, Pull Request, Issue.
        - External Events: Sending a POST request to a REST API.
        - Scheduled Times
        - Manually
    - Worflow 
        - Job: Each Job run independent from each other, they usually run in their individual runner machine in parallel. 
            - Runner Machine
                - GitHub Hosted Runners (Windows/Linux/MacOS tools installed)
                - Self Hosted Runners (More responsibility/More customization)
                - Larger Runners (Hosted by GitHub with more RAM & CPU)
